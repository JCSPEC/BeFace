This is the repo to host wrap up our project.

## Project Process

We started with research about existing APIs that can do face live tracking, and was very fortunate to find [clmtracker](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) --- a Javascript library for precise tracking of facial features via Constrained Local Models. The library provides basic functions such as tracking face in video, face substitution, face masking, real-time face deformation, emotion/gender detection and so on. These together offer a good starting point of our project. After weâ€™ve had a general idea of what we would like to achieve, we went on with design explorations about how the interface(simulator) would look like (Figure 1). Then came the feature development phase and finally the user interview.

## Notes for further development

After you're done, simple run this command to publish the website:
```
balabala
```

If you can't see the change after deploying, try to clean the pxt first and rebuild:

```
pxt clean
```
